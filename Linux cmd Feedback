This is my Feedback to the video about Linux Command line/ Bash Tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag
First of all, I want to say what I learned in this tutorial. I learned all the basic commands I need to work with Bash. How you create, edit and safe a directory and files are very well explained. Also the video teaches you how you can find or get informations about different commands. It also mentioned how you switch to another user and can find out who also is online.
To get back to my feedback, I really liked this tutorial. It may be a little bit long, but effective. The guy, who teaches you command line, explains easily understood. For those who do not understand English very well, there is English subtitle. Every command, he mentioned, is explained and demonstrated at the same time, so you can easily follow it. All in all, I recommend this video for everyone who wants to learn the command line and is interested in working with it.
