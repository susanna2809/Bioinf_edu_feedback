This is my feedback to the video about Nanopore sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genome by Phill James:
https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/nanopore-sequencing-sars-cov-2-genome-introduction-protocol
In this video he explains how the Nanopore sequencing works and why this method is advantageous to use it by SARS-CoV-2 genome. The steps of sequencing are described in detail and he also gives many tips that can be used in the laboratory. So he gives many usefull and important informations. This is a advantage. For those who only are interested in knowing what the Nanopore sequencing is this video might be too detailed. Furthermore Phill James is talking very fluently, so for those who are not so fluent or good in English it might be too fast and difficult to follow, as it was for me too.
All in all, this video is very good to learn about Nanopore sequencing. So I recommand this for everyone who wants to use the nanopore sequencing method or wants to learn more about it and everyone who is fluent in English. For those who are not, you can at least try it. :)
